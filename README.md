The goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to predict the future stock prices of various companies. 
The application utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to analyze historical stock price data and generate predictions. 
Users can interact with the application through a simple web interface to select a stock ticker and view the predicted price trends, as well as a recommendation on whether to invest in that stock based on the predicted outcome.
This project offers a practical application of machine learning in finance, allowing users to leverage advanced models for stock market analysis. 
It is designed to be easily extensible, enabling future enhancements like adding more stocks, incorporating different types of predictive models, or even expanding into other financialÂ instruments.
